<h3>Hello! My name is Kanin and I'm a self-taught software developer.</h3>

<h2>About Me</h2>

- Unity3D and C# (since 2018)
- Typically work with 2D however 3D is what I really want to work with
- Have tried many langauges: C, C++, Java, <a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/safe-sound/121519">Python (made a game using Pygame when I had just turned 16)</a>, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

<h2>Projects</h2>
<h4><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.CieriusGames.Avoideroids&hl=en_US&gl=US">Avoideroids</a> - A casual mobile game, think old school Asteroids but you avoid them! <a href="https://github.com/cierius/Avoideroids">Source Code</a></h4>

- Accrued about 40 downloads in first 2 weeks
- Developed using the Godot game engine as a learning project over about a month
- Gained a general knowledge as to the capabilities of android devices as a whole (my code was not optimized, looking back at it hurts)


<h4><a href="https://cieriusgames.itch.io/pong-clone">Pong_Clone</a> - Just as it sounds: a clone of the old Pong game!</h4>

- Another short learning project where I set out to try and deep dive into Unity after exploring Godot with my previous project (Avoideroids)
- This project was an MVP - Minimum Viable Product; the game works, but there are bugs galore
- Development for this project was over the course of about month once again
- Published on Itch.io 


<h4><a href="https://github.com/cierius/DoD">Project Shmup (AKA DoD)</a> + <a href="">Project Shapes</a></h4>

- These two projects are merely work in progresses at the current time but they're projects where I learned a lot of the inner working of Unity3D
- 2D top down shoot 'em up style games with an emphasis on modularity (items and boosts) to effect the player (roguelite elements)
- Inspired by games like Binding of Isaac, Risk of Rain (1 & 2), Borderlands
- A* pathfinding for the units in Project Shmup - <a href="https://github.com/cierius/DoD/blob/main/Shmup/Assets/Scripts/Enemy%20Related%20Scripts/AIManager.cs">Source Code</a>
- Started using and learning shaders with Project Shapes


<h4><a href="">Ball Project</a> - Current game in development for mobile iOS and Android</h4>
