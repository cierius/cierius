Hello! My name is Kanin and I'm a game developer that's looking to turn a hobby into a career. I put most of my little projects here because I work on my laptop and my desktop.

Currently working on (and planning on working on):
- (Current project) A old school pong game
- (Future) Punch Out inspired 2D fighter
- (Future) Mortal Kombat inspired 2D side-scrolling fighter
- (Future) MarioKart inspired 3D kart racing game
- (Future) Call of Duty inspired 3D FPS

These five projects are my endevour this year as I try to build a portfolio to get me into the industry.
